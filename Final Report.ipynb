    "Employee Performance and Retention Analysis\n",
    "Final Report\n",
    "1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Employee performance and retention are critical factors that directly impact an organization’s productivity, stability, and growth. High employee attrition leads to increased recruitment costs, loss of skilled talent, and reduced organizational efficiency. This project aims to analyze employee data using statistical, machine learning, and deep learning techniques to understand performance patterns and predict employee attrition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project applies concepts from probability, statistics, machine learning, and deep learning to derive insights and build predictive models that help organizations make data-driven HR decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project contains employee-level information with the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Employee ID\n",
    "\n",
    "Name\n",
    "\n",
    "Age\n",
    "\n",
    "Department\n",
    "\n",
    "Salary\n",
    "\n",
    "Years at Company\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Score\n",
    "\n",
    "Attrition (Yes/No)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset represents a real-world HR scenario and was cleaned to remove duplicates and ensure consistency before analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "3.1 Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Key observations from descriptive statistics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "The average employee age is around early 30s, indicating a relatively young workforce.\n",
    "\n",
    "Salary shows high variation, suggesting differences based on department, experience, and role.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance scores are mostly concentrated between average and high values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Employees have varying tenure, ranging from newly joined employees to long-tenured staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2 Data Visualization Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Pairplot Analysis revealed that salary tends to increase with years at the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation Heatmap showed a strong positive correlation between salary and years at company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boxplots indicated a few high-value outliers in salary and tenure, which are realistic and expected in organizational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the dataset showed no abnormal patterns or severe anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Probability and Statistical Analysis\n",
    "4.1 Probability Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of employee attrition was calculated to understand how many employees leave the organization. Results showed that attrition is more common among employees with lower performance scores and shorter tenure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.2 Bayes’ Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes’ Theorem was applied to calculate the probability of employee attrition given a low performance score. The analysis indicated that employees with lower performance scores have a higher likelihood of leaving, either voluntarily or involuntarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.3 Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothesis test was conducted to determine whether mean performance scores differ across departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H₀): Mean performance scores are the same across departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Mean performance scores differ across departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using ANOVA, the results suggested that performance scores vary across departments, highlighting the influence of departmental roles and work environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Predictive Modeling\n",
    "5.1 Employee Attrition Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "A Logistic Regression model was used to predict employee attrition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model achieved good accuracy on the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision, recall, and F1-score indicated balanced performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The confusion matrix showed that the model was effective in identifying employees likely to leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model can help HR teams identify high-risk employees early.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.2 Employee Performance Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "A Linear Regression model was used to predict employee performance scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model achieved a reasonable R² score, indicating a good fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE) was low, showing accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Salary, years at company, and department were important predictors of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Deep Learning Models\n",
    "6.1 Deep Learning for Performance Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "A feedforward neural network was built using TensorFlow/Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model successfully learned non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance prediction accuracy improved slightly compared to linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning proved effective for complex feature interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.2 Deep Learning for Attrition Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network classification model was used for attrition prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model achieved high accuracy on test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results confirmed that deep learning can enhance attrition prediction when sufficient data is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Key Insights and Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Salary and tenure are strongly related to employee performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Employees with low performance scores and shorter tenure are at higher risk of attrition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain departments show higher attrition rates, indicating possible workload or management issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning models provide improved prediction capability for complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are suggested:\n",
    "\n",
    "Early Intervention Programs: Identify low-performing employees early and provide training or mentorship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Department-Specific Strategies: Address high-attrition departments with targeted engagement programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance-Based Incentives: Introduce incentives to retain high-performing employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data-Driven HR Decisions: Use predictive models to proactively manage retention risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully demonstrated how data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning can be applied to employee performance and retention analysis. The findings highlight key factors influencing employee behavior and provide actionable insights for HR decision-making. With larger datasets, these models can be further improved and deployed in real-world organizational environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Future Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Use larger, real-world datasets for improved model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Include additional features such as job satisfaction and work-life balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploy models using dashboards for real-time HR analytics."
